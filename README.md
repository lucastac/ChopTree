# ChopTree - Script Animation Sample
A Unity project with some scripted animations: shake, move and scale.

During the game just touch the screen (or press spacebar if in a computer) to run the animation of choping a trunk of the tree. Once tree is over, a new one will be spawned and the process is repeated infinitely.
